## CryptoCSVgen BETA v0.1.0
 subject to change, some features may be broken.


This is a Python app that lets you download historical cryptocurrency data from Yahoo Finance using a simple interface. You can:

* Search and select from a list of crypto tickers
* Choose time intervals (like 1m, 5m, 1h, etc.)
* Select preset or custom date ranges
* Export the data to a CSV file
* View logs and test the connection directly from the app

Itâ€™s useful for anyone who wants to quickly pull precise crypto market data without writing any code or using yahoo's interface (limited timeframes)

### Requirements

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Linux (WSL or virtual machine works fine) Works on Windows and macOS in theory. 

**Note:** `tkinter` comes pre-installed with most Python distributions on Windows but this does not mean it will be in WSL by default. If not, reinstall Python with the commands seen below.

### Install/Run

1. Open this folder in WSL/Linux VM whatever you have.
2. Create python venv using `python3 -m venv cryptocsv` *if not already installed python3.10-venv library will be needed*
3. Open that python venv using `source cryptocsv/bin/activate`
4. install requirements for crypto_collector.py using `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
5. Open script with `python3 crypto_collector.py` *if not already installed python3.10-tk library will be needed* (install tkinter using `apt install python3.10-tk`)

OR run these commands inside cryptocsvgen directory

`sudo apt install python3.10-venv python3.10-tk -y`
`python3 -m venv cryptocsv`
`source cryptocsv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python3 crypto_collector.py`


## Notes

* For intraday intervals (like 1m or 5m), Yahoo Finance only allows data for the past \~60 days.
* Results are saved to CSV file you choose where.
